        <h1>Dataset requirements</h1>
    </header>
		<br>
    <p>
        <h3>R1: Data are in one of the selected smart city domains.</h3>
        Yes.<br>
        The data is about public transportation, and in particular about the
				existing bicycle network within the City of Boston, with bike stations
				and trips.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        <h3>R2: Data are available as a CSV file.</h3>
        Yes.<br>
        The three datasets of interest are available in that format.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        <h3>R3: Data have an open license so they can be published.</h3>
        Yes.<br>
        The first 2 datasets have PPDL license. You are free:<br>
        •	To Share: To copy, distribute and use the database.<br>
        •	To Create: To produce works from the database.<br>
        •	To Adapt: To modify, transform and build upon the database.<br>
        As long as you:<br>
        •	Blank: This section is intentionally left blank. The PDDL imposes no
				restrictions on your use of the PDDL licensed database.<br>
        Source:
				<a href="https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/pddl/summary/">
					https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/pddl/summary/
				</a><br><br>

        The license of the third dataset is more restrictive: Motivate hereby
				grants to you a non-exclusive, royalty-free, limited, perpetual license
				to access, reproduce, analyze, copy, modify, distribute in your product
				or service and use the Data for any lawful purpose (“License”). <br>
        Prohibited Conduct: Host, stream, publish, distribute, sublicense, or
				sell the Data as a stand-alone dataset; provided, however, you may
				include the Data as source material, as applicable, in analyses,
				reports, or studies published or distributed for non-commercial
				purposes. <br>
        However, as stated above, we are able to use the dataset as source
				material in our analysis.<br>

    <p>
        <h3>R4: Data can be easily linked with generic real-world entities.</h3>
        Yes.<br>
        It can be linked with different types of generic real-world entities:
				bike's stations, streets, potentially the bike themselves, etc.<br><br>

        Moreover, some entities can be easily linked with entities in other datasets.<br>
        The streets (identified by their name in STREET_NAM in our datasets) can be linked with
				streets entries in famous geographocal datasets such as
				the one from OpenStreetMaps; the same can be said for the multiple other
				entities in our dataset that are related to geographical locations.

        Regarding entities in other datsets that could be linked with entities
				in our datasets, apart from the already mentioned ones, we could find
				information regarding other less relevant entities linked with our
				domain given our information, such as, for example,the bike themselves
				(that could be linked with bike entries and add additional details about
				them, which is not considered of interest in our context).
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        <h3>R5: Documentation exists for the data.</h3>
        Yes. <br>

    <br>
    <p>
        <h3>R6: Data can come from multiple data sources.</h3>
        Yes.<br>
        We observe that the data comes from two different sources. <br>
        The first two datasets are owned by the City of Boston and published
				by Boston Maps. <br>
        For the third one, Blue Bikes (formerly Hubway) is owned by the
				municipalities of Boston, Brookline, Cambridge and Somerville, and
				operated by Motivate International, Inc. This external website,
				maintained by Motivate International, Inc., provides datasets on
				Blue Bikes usage.
