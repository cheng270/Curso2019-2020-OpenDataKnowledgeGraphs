  <h3>Description of the application</h3>
  <p>It's a 3D model (we plan to use the three.js library to generate it) where you can put the mouse over each zone and it shows you "air quality" and "green zones" data about that zone. You can also visualize the MIN and MAX values by postal code by clicking in the bottom bar.</p>

  <p>This is our "design goal" but we could modify this a little bit during the course if we find it to difficult to reproduce.</p>
