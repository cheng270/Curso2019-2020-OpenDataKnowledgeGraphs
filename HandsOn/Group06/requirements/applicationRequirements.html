            <h2>Description of the application</h2>
            We aim to use Open Data of the City of Boston about the bike network, stations and trips in order to create an application for the user: a person who wants to ride a bike in Boston.<br>
            The complete application should have a map with the bicycle lanes available, the estimated traffic in those, the locations of BlueBike stations, and how many bikes/parking spots are available in each station.<br>
            Additional functionalities can potentially be build on top of that, such as advising a preferable route for the user to take, considering the usual traffic conditions and the bicycle lanes available, or ranking the usage and popularity of both routes and bike stations.<br>

            <h2>Mock-ups of the final interface</h2>
            This section displays some mock-ups regarding the approximate look that the final application might have. Moreover, some of the previously described functionalities are shown.<br>
            This is just a very general representation, and the final product might significantly differ from the one displayed here.<br><br><br>
