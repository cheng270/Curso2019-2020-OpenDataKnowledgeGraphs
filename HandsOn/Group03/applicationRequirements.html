        Description:
    </h2>
    <p>
      The main idea is to develop a mobile application where you can introduce the variaables related to your situtation
      and the application will give you a score of how dangerous or safe is going to be your trip.
    <p>
    <p>
      In order to achieve this task we are going to do the nexts steps:
    </p>
    <li>
      <ul>
        Relate the data with other datasources like as events in Leeds city
      </ul>
      <ul>
        Use a predicting algorithm for getting the risk
      </ul>
      <ul>
        Publish an api for recieving querys from the mobile application
      </ul>
      <ul>
        Develop a mobile application for :
        <li>
          <ul>
            Introducing the variables
          </ul>
          <ul>
            Consuming the api
          </ul>
          <ul>
            See the obtained risk score
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <p>
      With that score you will be able to know on how careful you should drive for example, or let know to an AI system this score as variable for driving better.
