        <h2>Air Quality in Madrid Data Set satisfy the following requirements:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>R1-Description.
			<p>Collect the concentration of particles to know if they are harmful to health in 
			   the different measurement stations, located in different points of the city of Madrid</p>
		  </li>
          <li>R2. Data set is available as a CSV file.</li>
          <li>R3-License.
			  <p> All the data present in this dataset comes from Madrid's City Council Open Data website, 
				  which are the ones to be acknowledged for the data collection.
			      The data therefore inherits the Madrid Open Data Terms of Use, 
			      which allow for free commercial and non-commercial use, and provide no liability on the data.</p>
          </li>
          <li>R4. Data can be easily linked with generic real-world entities
            (e.g., locations, like for example locations as Madrid and the diferents streets where the starion are located).</li>
          <li>R5-Documentation.
			 <p> All the data is extracted from the original files and processed to result in a more convenient format for typical Kaggle purposes. 
			  While the original data includes hours as different columns and measurements as different rows, this version is structured 
			  the other way round: Each row is timestamped and the columns are the different measures performed at that point in time in
			  a certain stations. This allows faster preparation for time series analysis and prediction tasks.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
