  </ul>

  <h3>License</h3>

  <h3>Entities that can be linked with the dataset</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <h4>Location (Latitude and Longitude)</h4>
      <p>
        <br>
        Latitude and Longitude data is known for each one of the wi-fi spots.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Location (Street Name and Number)</h4>
      <p>
        <br>
        Street Name and Number data is known for each one of the wi-fi spots and can be linked to their location data (latitude and longitude) and be shown on a map.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>City</h4>
      <p>
        <br>
      Neighborhoods in New York
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Provider (Carrier ID)</h4>
      <p>
      <br>
      Carrier ID data of each wi-fi spot can be linked to their location data (latitude and longitude) so wifi spot's locations can be checked for each provider.
    </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Entities that can be linked with other datasets</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h4>Location (Latitude and Longitude)</h4>
      <p>
        <br>
        Latitude and Longitude data is known for each one of the wi-fi spots.<br>
        Other datasets which include location data can be linked to the location data of our current dataset. For example, this dataset (<a href="  https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Points-Of-Interest/rxuy-2muj
">link</a>), consists in a database of points of interest of the city of New York, based on their latitude and longitude. Therefore, nearby points of interest could be tracked for each wi-fi spot based on its location.
