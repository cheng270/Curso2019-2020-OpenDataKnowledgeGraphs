Pedestrian Flow project
==================

The demo of our project can be seen in the following [DataStudio](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/b3178807-28f6-4602-9ec9-cbe428dd9077/page/dXz3)

The virtuoso endpoint which provides the rdf pedestrian dataset is the following:
[PedestrianDataSet](http://vocab.linkeddata.es/sparql/pedestrians/)

The pedestrian dataset is connected using the following connector to google studio:
[Connector](https://github.com/DataFabricRus/datastudio-sparql-connector)

The variables which are used in the connector are visible under the following link:

# GitHub structure

* All the hands-on materials under the “HandsOn” directory
* Each group will create a directory in github for uploading all the materials of the hands-on. 
* Group directories must follow the format "GroupXX" where "XX" is the number of the group (e.g., "Group01"). Group numbers will be created in a first come-first served basis, starting from number 1 and giving consecutive numbers.

# Group directory (/HandsOn/GroupXX) contents

* /README.md - A Markdown document with the names and GitHub users of the members of the group 
* /csv/* - CSV files with the datasets selected 
* /requirements/datasetRequirements.html - An HTML document that discusses whether the selected datasets satisfy the requirements. All the requirements must be satisfied by the datasets with the exception of the optional requirements; for these, the degree of satisfaction must be discussed
* /requirements/applicationRequirements.html - An HTML document that specifies the requirements of the application that will be built, with user interface mock-ups
* /selfAssessmentHandsOn1.md - A Markdown document with the hands-on 1 self-assessment
* /analysis.html - An HTML document that includes the analyses performed over the data source and the licensing of the data source, as well as the resource naming strategy defined.
* /ontology/*.ttl - An OWL file (using the Turtle syntax) with the ontology developed, according to the resource naming strategy defined.
* /selfAssessmentHandsOn2.md - A Markdown document with the hands-on 2 self-assessment
