    	<ul>
  	<li>The URI domain to be used is <b>http://group03.org/</b> . This domain is chosen because it's available.</li>
  	<li> A subfolder "saferoad" will be added to the domain as the ontology model and the data are related to "saferoads" application.</li>
  	<li> Ontology model classes: the classes in the ontology will have the form
	<b>http://www.group03.org/saferoads/<i>OntologyNAME#ClassNAME</i></b></li>
  	<li>Ontology model properties: the properties in the ontology will have the form 
	<b>http://www.group03.org/saferoads/<i>OntologyNAME</i>#<i>PropertyNAME</i></b></li>
  	<li>Instances: the instances in the ontology will have the form
	<b>http://www.group03.org/saferoads/TrafficAccidentsontology/resource/<i>ClassNAME</i>#<i>IDENTIFIER</i></b></li>
